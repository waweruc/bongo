# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in Liam ERD! This document explains how you can engage with the project.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Our contribution policy

Liam ERD is developed by the core team, and **we do not accept unsolicited external Pull Requests.** Pull requests opened without a prior invitation from the team will be closed without review.

This is not a judgment on the value of your work. Writing code has become inexpensive, but reviewing it carefully still depends on limited maintainer attention, and every external change widens the project's supply-chain surface. To keep Liam ERD secure and maintainable, code changes are merged by the core team.

This does **not** mean we don't want to hear from you — quite the opposite. There are many valuable ways to get involved, listed below.

## How you can contribute

- **Report a bug** — [open a bug report](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/issues/new) with clear steps to reproduce.
- **Share an idea or ask a question** — start a thread on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/discussions).
- **Report a security issue** — please follow our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) rather than opening a public issue.
- **Spread the word** — star the repo and tell others who might find Liam ERD useful.

## Development environment setup

Before setting up the development environment, we recommend reviewing our [Repository Architecture](https://liambx.com/docs/contributing/repository-architecture) documentation to understand how our packages are organized.

To set up a development environment, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/liam-hq/liam
   ```

2. Run the setup script

   ```sh
   ./scripts/setup-local-dev.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Install dependencies with pnpm
   - Create .env file from template
   - Start Supabase database
   - Configure Supabase authentication keys
   - Display next steps and test credentials

   Alternatively, you can run the setup steps manually:

   ```sh
   corepack enable
   corepack prepare
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables

   Copy the template environment file to create your local environment file:

   ```sh
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

   **Required for basic local development:**
   - Supabase keys will be automatically configured when you start the database (see step 4)

   **For maintainers (Vercel team members only):**

   Link your local project to the Vercel project and pull environment variables:

   ```sh
   pnpm vercel:link
   pnpm vercel:env-pull
   ```



   Next, create a `.env.local` file at the root directory and set values for the following keys:

   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`

4. Start the development server

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. Open apps

   | package            | url                   |
   | ------------------ | --------------------- |
   | bongo       | http://localhost:3001 |
   | @liam-hq/cli       | http://localhost:5173 |
   | @liam-hq/docs      | http://localhost:3002 |
   | @liam-hq/storybook | http://localhost:6006 |

   **Test login credentials:**
   - Login path: http://localhost:3001/app/login
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `liampassword1234`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

**GitHub API Errors in Console**
If you see errors like `[@octokit/auth-app] appId option is required`, this is expected when GitHub environment variables are not configured. These errors don't affect core functionality - you can still use authentication, view projects, and access ER diagrams.

**Login Page Redirects**
If `/app/login` redirects unexpectedly:
1. Ensure Supabase is running: `pnpm --filter @liam-hq/db supabase:status`
2. Check that Supabase keys are configured in `.env`
3. Restart the development server: `pnpm dev`

**Database Connection Issues**
If you encounter database connection problems:
1. Stop Supabase: `pnpm --filter @liam-hq/db supabase:stop`
2. Start Supabase: `pnpm --filter @liam-hq/db supabase:start`
3. Re-run key extraction scripts:
   ```sh
   ./scripts/extract-supabase-anon-key.sh
   ./scripts/extract-supabase-service-key.sh
   ```

**Missing Dependencies**
If you encounter missing dependency errors:
1. Ensure you have the correct Node.js version (check `.nvmrc`)
2. Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`
3. Enable corepack: `corepack enable && corepack prepare`

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.
